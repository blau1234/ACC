Domain Tools Utils - Atomic functions for domain-specific tools

This package contains low-level atomic functions that serve as building blocks
for domain tools. These functions are not registered in the tool registry and
are not directly selectable by tool selection - they are meant to be used by
upper-level domain tools and tool creators.

Packages:
- ifcopenshell: Atomic functions for IFC data operations
- topologicpy: Atomic functions for topological analysis
